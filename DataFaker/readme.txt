## Intended to bake a fake-data production pipelines as infrastructure. 
## To offer simple functions to fake large amount data which is often time unavailable in validation-time.

## Philosophy:
   In develop-time, the functionality validation is tedious. 
   Often time, we manaually create databases, tables, views, columns, etc to simulate the production scenerio.
   After that, we manaually drop databases, tables, views, columns one by one which is time consuming.
   In this work, we are going to free our hands and unlabrate develops who are headache with these tasks everyday.
## First Stage To Do List:
#### functions:
       1.test-db-manager();
       2.test-db-creater();
       3.test-db-droper(); 
       4.test-db-table-creater();
       5....as basic functionality.
